The original repo which hosts the sample codes is no longer actively maintained. I finished this book and am excited about it, so thought of helping other learners on their journey to learning to Tornado.

I've updated the original code to account for the changes in the [Tornado 4.3](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/releases/v4.3.0.html) release, Python 3.5 and [OAuth 2.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauth2) and few other bits and pieces here and there.

Please raise an issue/request if you think something is not working as expected or is broken. I would be happy help.

Thanks,
Ben!
